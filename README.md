This repository contains three projects completed during my Front End Web Developer journey with Udacity. Each project showcases different aspects of web development, and they were built as part of the Udacity Nanodegree program.

## Projects

### 1. Personal Blog


In this project, I created a personal blog website using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript. The blog features multiple pages with engaging content and a clean and responsive design. It demonstrates my ability to structure a web page, style it effectively, and incorporate some interactive elements.



### 2. Landing Page



The Landing Page project involved building a multi-section landing page with a navigation menu dynamically created using JavaScript. This project showcases my understanding of DOM manipulation and smooth scrolling techniques. The landing page is fully responsive and optimized for various devices.



### 3. Weather Journal Web App



The Weather Journal Web App is a dynamic web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to enter their current location and feelings and fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app then displays the weather information along with the user's feelings.
